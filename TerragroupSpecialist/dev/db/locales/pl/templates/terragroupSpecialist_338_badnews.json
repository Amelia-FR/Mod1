	"Name": "\"Bad News\" .338 Lapua Magnum",
	"ShortName": "\"Bad News\"",
	"Description": "The “Bad News” in .338 Lapua has become a signature rifle for Noreen Firearms. The rifle was originally designed with the intent of taking a well-known large caliber, and being able to send it downrange accurately, further than any other semi-automatic rifle on the market. Now, with the Bad News Gen. II, we’ve taken a rifle that was already a long-distance powerhouse, and completely upgraded it. With new upgraded receivers, a new gas block, and a mean looking hand-guard, the new Bad News takes everything you loved from the first gen, and made it even better. We took a “signature rifle”, and turned it into a masterpiece."
