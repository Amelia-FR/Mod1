so what time is it of UTC-5? 3 A.M. i guess.....i'm in the UTC+8 so there may be some jet lag issues ....
ok back to the point i checked the bundle of tgs mod, most of bundle and  .338 weapons is working well but m16a4 broken, i install the M16A4 mod, in this mod it's working well but in tgs it's broken, idk why. and eth coin use the same bundle of btc and just change the tex, idk how tgs to do or how it work in old version, but for now there is  a problem, eth cion, or btc, there always just one can work, it's mean eth coin's bundle need rebuild, i think i can do that.
ok thats all, we can talk about the details during the day (or night for me)
