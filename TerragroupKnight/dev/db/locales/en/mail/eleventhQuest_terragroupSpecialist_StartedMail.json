"So my boy, I managed to get some information about stocks of experimental drugs hidden in a cache at the mall. Apparently, they were planning to test the drugs on the local population. Intel states that itâ€™s located in some sort of armory, with some MS2000 Markers in the crates so they can be transported. I need you to find out where the crates are located, remove the markers, and report back to me! "
