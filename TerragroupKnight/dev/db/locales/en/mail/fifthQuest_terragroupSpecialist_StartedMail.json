"Good work, dodger- listen to me, carefully. I need you to bring me a particular weapon- a Colt M4A1 with a 20inch barrel, a Colt buffer tube and a Colt charging handle, a High Standard M4SS Stock, a tan PMAG M3 30 FDE magazine, a colt A2 pistol grip, a URX 3.1 10,75inch handguard, a low-profile MK12 gas block, and that it all comes from the Laboratory. It'd be great if all of it came from there- then I'd be certain it's all compatible with what I want to do. Get moving, buddy!"
